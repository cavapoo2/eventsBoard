INTRO
-----

This is my first react/typescript app still work in progress.
Its a simple events/ booking system. Users can sign up (register) and log in and see current events. Admin users create events for normal users to see. Normal users can then book events. 
The front end is using typescript and the backend is golang. The backend is using mongo db (2 instances) to persist as well as rabbitmq to send messages to either database. This is also Dockerized. 

INSTALL
-------
`go get -u github.com/cavapoo2/eventsBoard`

cd into tools and run:

`go build builder.go`

then cd .. and run 

`tools\builder`

that should build the main programs for golang back end the booking service and event service

cd into booking_front and run (note you need node installed, I'm using node v8.11.3 and npm 5.6.0 on ubuntu 16.04)

`npm install` 

to set up the back end (only tested locally)

first make sure you have rabbitmq setup (this is for ubuntu via docker)
docker run --detach \
--name rabbitmq \
-p 5672:5672 \
-p 15672:15672 \
rabbitmq:3-management

make sure mongo is setup/installed.

in the /eventService folder run the main in a terminal . this will use rest at localhost:8181 mongo at port default(27017).
For this i started mongo prior to running this main via sudo service mongod start (this uses 27017) and gets its config from /etc/mongo.conf

in another terminal do mongod --dbpath ~/go/src/andy/booking/bookingservice/db --port 27018
you now have 2 instances of mongo running

in another terminal run the /bookingservice main (./main -conf=config.json) .Check this config it sets up mongo to use port 27018
and the rest is localhost:8182

open 2 more terminals one for (both for mongo cli)  
mongo --port 27017
and another
mongo --port 27018

now use the bash script to create an even (newEvent). and another to create a new user (newUser). check the mongo cli
both these scripts talk to endpoint localhost:8181. these events are written to mongo db (27017) and via amqp its replicated
to the other mongo db at 27018. 
now send a makeBooking . this talks to end point localhost:8182, and updates the mongo db at 27018 only.

#Note to dockerize this would do as follows:
#make sure the binary exe's in both bookingservice and eventservice are name to these names rather than main.

#create Dockerfile like this in each of the bookingservice and eventservice folders 
#event service docker file

FROM debian:jessie
COPY eventservice /eventservice
RUN useradd eventservice
USER eventservice
ENV LISTEN_URL=0.0.0.0:8181
EXPOSE 8181
CMD ["/eventservice"]

#build the image like this
docker image build -t myevents/eventservice .

#bookingservice docker file

FROM debian:jessie
COPY bookingservice /bookingservice
RUN useradd bookingservice
USER bookingservice
ENV LISTEN_URL=0.0.0.0:8181
EXPOSE 8181
CMD ["/bookingservice"]

#build image like this
docker image build -t myevents/bookingservice .

#the container network like this
docker network create myevents

#rabbitmq like this
docker container run -d --name rabbitmq --network myevents
rabbitmq:3-management

#events-db like this
docker container run -d --name events-db --network myevents mongo
#bookings-db like this (make sure its a seperate instance, hence 20718)
docker container run -d -p 20718:20718 --name bookings-db --network myevents mongo

#eventservice 
docker container run \
--detach \
--name events \
--network myevents \
-e AMQP_BROKER_URL=amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672/ \
-e MONGO_URL=mongodb://events-db/events \
-p 8181:8181 \
myevents/eventservice

#bookingservice
docker container run --detach --name bookings --network myevents -e AMQP_BROKER_URL=amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672/ -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://bookings-db/bookings -p 8182:8181 myevents/bookingservice

#booking_front
docker container build -t myevents/frontend .
#then
docker container run --name frontend -p 80:80 myevents/frontend	 


############
## Alternatively rather than using docker as above (whuch is good way to test its all working) can instead use the ##docker-compose which will build and run the whole lot in one go
docker-compose up -d

CREATING SOME ADMIN USERS
--------------------------

#use the simpleEvent.go in tools to build some json input files for testing the backend. 
#use the bash scripts to send GET/POST messages.
#use the builder to build project go files (see other directory (simple builder)



#check its all running with docker ps -a
#use the bash script 
newEvent outx.json 
#to send events
#also bash sript to send new user
newUser userx.json
#then you can make booking via
makeBooking bash script.

#you can view this by going to http://localhost



TODO (LOTS!)
------------

There is lots more work that could be done with this such as :
(1) Test more, add testing, Unit testing , improve code structures.
(2) improve user interface. Its using very simple Bootstrap right now.
(3) Think how this can be scaled better. 
(4) improve authentication. Its really basic email and password so far.
(5) add travis or CI
(6) improve logging
(7) maybe use redux. 
(8) monitoring (data dog)
